## Learning Journal - 28.04.2025 (Monday)

Topic: TryHackMe - Windows Fundamentals 1 (Task 7)

Time spent: Around 2hrs


## What I learned today?

- I finished my first TryHackMe room! I know this might be nothing but for me, it's a big milestone. It's a little achievement which puts me one step forward in my journey to securing a job in the industry.
- I had a chance to test out Desktop Remote Connection again, this time without any issues. I connected with the user account I needed. It's a sign that I've learned how to do it. 
- With little help of ChatGBT, I tested my knowledge. I took several tests with open and closed questions. It helped me to check what I've learned during this THM room and what I have to do to solidify knowledge. In general I did very well the in tests, my procentage never fell below 90%, which is great but the learning material is not very demanding - basic fundamental stuff. 

## What was difficult for me?

- When I reviewed the material I noticed that I can't describe certain concepts as technically as they are in the notes. Again, the problem comes from the fact that I'm not a native speaker, and I know that I have to put more work that the average person, so this is something I need to focus on as well. I need to explain things in a more technical way than I do with my own words.

## My reflections

- To be honest, I didn't feel like doing any work today. I had not so great day at work, but neverthless I sat down and did at least a litle bit - which I'm grateful for. It's not much, and everyone have bad days. I just feel like that it's not what I could've achieved today but at least it's something. I sat down and did the work. 
- It's frustrating when I struggle with basic things like explaining the technical nuances. I know what is what and I can explain it, but this is not so great. I think with more practice and time, I'll get used to it, and the technical jargon won't be as much of a problem as it is now.
- I finished my first room on TryHackMe. I just need to finish notes for that room and will try to cement the definitions of concepts I learned there so I can move to Windows Fundamentals 2. However, I don't want to rush things, but to learn properly. It might take me longer, but I think this is crucial.
I hope to finish it tomorrow or at least day after tomorrow for sure.

## Plans for tomorrow:

- Take notes for Task 8 and 9
- Review the material Iâ€™ve learned so far and try to explain concepts in more technical jargon.

## In near future:
- basic git cheat-sheet in form of notes
